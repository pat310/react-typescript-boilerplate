#Typescript-React-Webpack Boilerplate
Scaffolding to quickly create a React/Typescript project. The following technologies are used:
* **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - strongly typed Javascript language
* **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** - front-end framework
* **[React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)** - front-end routing
* **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)** - Build tool
* **[Styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs)** - CSS styling

**Note:** The scaffolding takes advantage webpack-dev-server rather than launching an actual server. 

## Starting the scaffolding
1. Go to the project root directory
2. `npm install` or `yarn install` in the terminal to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` in the terminal
4. Go to localhost:8080 in the browser
